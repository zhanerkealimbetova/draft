<h2>History of Almaty</h2>
<img src="https://esquire.kz/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4.-voznesenskii-759x1024.jpg" alt="Вознесенский собор" width="300" height="300"> 
<br>
<p><i>The earliest settlements</i> predating Almaty were founded in the 6th-3rd centuries BC. In the 8th-9th centuries a small <i> Silk Road settlement</i> here was already called <b>Almatu</b>. In the 13th century Almatu was conquered by the Mongols, an event recorded by Zahir-ad-Din Muhammad Babur, founder of the Mughal Dynasty. A century later the city appeared in written sources as Almalyk, but by the end of the 16th century only a remnant of the original Almatu remained.
<br><br>
    <i> Modern Almaty</i> was founded in the mid-19th century when the Russian government built a military fortification here. The outpost, called <b> Vernoye (Verny)</b>, began to attract Russian settlers. By 1897 nearly 23 thousand people lived in Verny, of which about 60 percent were Russians. By 1913 the population had already reached 41,000.
    <br><br>
    Old Verny was located in the neighborhood of Malaya Stanitsa, where Rakhat Candy Factory and Iversko-Serafimovsky Convent are now located. (Incidentally, the convent was built on site of the city’s first Orthodox church). On February 5, 1921, Verny was renamed <b>Alma-Ata</b> in honor of its historic name. Six years later Alma-Ata became the capital of the Kazakh ASSR. In 1993, shortly after Kazakhstan gained independence, the city was renamed <b>Almaty</b>.
    <br><br>
    In 1997 Kazakhstan transferred its <i> capital</i> from Almaty to Astana. The following year <b> Almaty</b> was given official status as a special city and continues to hold the unofficial title of <b> Southern Capital of Kazakhstan</b>. Today Almaty covers an area of 682 square kilometers and is divided into 8 districts. As of summer 2021 it had a population of over 2 million.</p>

    <p>The historical center of Kazakhstan, Almaty is worth visiting just for its 33 museums whose unique expositions are sure to include items of interest for every type of traveler. Central State Museum of Kazakhstan, Kasteev Museum of Art, Kunaev's Apartment-Museum and Museum of Almaty are the most frequently visited, yet the Archeology Museum, Museum of Folk Musical Instruments, Nature Museum, Museum of Rare Books, the relatively new Museum of Kazakh Cinema and others are also worth seeing. Almaty also has many house museums dedicated to famous city figures.</p>

    <p>To fly to Almaty and not visit any of its 21 theaters is simply a crime. Abay State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater holds performances of world classics, while Lermontov State Academic Russian Drama Theater attracts even young people with its productions. For many years the famous Kazakhstan-born actor Vladimir Tolokonnikov served at this theater, which continues to employ many esteemed Kazakh artists.
<br>
        Auezov Kazakh Drama Theater, Kuzhamyarov Uyghur Theatre of Musical Comedy, Musrepov Youth Theatre and State Puppet Theatre all stage classical performances, while various chamber theaters can also be found. At ARTiSHOCK, a revolutionary endeavor for Kazakhsan’s theatrical arts, directors stage fascinating plays where the plots are often not what they originally seem.</p>

<!--It is subparagraphs in the section of Almaty Parks-->
    <p>Almaty is a green city, with each district having its own squares and parks. It is difficult to name the most popular, for each one has something unique to offer.
<br><br>
    <b> First President’s Park</b> occupies almost 61.5 thousand hectares. Almaty residents come here to inhale the clean air, ride bicycles and simply relax. There are no rides in this park, but there are many trees and shrubs - more than 11 thousand, to be exact. If Almaty had lungs, they would be found in First President’s Park!
    <br><br>
    <b> Central Park of Culture and Leisure</b> (and the nearby zoo) has many trees, benches and rides and is one of the top things to do in Almaty for families with children.
    <br><br>
     <b>Kok-Tobe</b>, the highest park in Almaty, overlooks the city from the mountainside and has been visited by many celebrities over the years. You can reach Kok-Tobe by car, but we recommend riding the cable car for a more picturesque and memorable journey.
    <br><br>
     <b> Park of 28 Panfilov Guardsmen</b> is one of the oldest in Almaty. It is lined with dozens of ancient oaks and other trees but is best known for Ascension Cathedral, which stands in the center of the park. Panfilov Park is also famous for its thousands of pigeons which are well-fed by city residents.
    <br><br>
     <b> Almaty Botanical Garden </b> has sadly lost much of its originality after large-scale reconstruction but is still very beautiful, with thousands of unique plants. It is now best to visit the park with a guide.
    <br><br>
     <b> Terrenkur</b> is not a park per se but a health path which winds for 4.5 kilometers. The path is shaded by trees, making Terrenkur a pleasant walk even during the heat of summer.
    <br><br>
    Anyone looking for silence and solitude should visit First President’s Park, Esentai Park, Ile-Alatau National Park and Butakovsky Gorge. The latter two are located on the quiet outskirts of town.</p>
